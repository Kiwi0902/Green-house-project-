# Leaf Color Classification Algorithm
This algorithm uses raw RGB values from the APDS-9960 color sensor to classify the plantâ€™s leaf condition

1. Collect Data
Place the sensor close to healthy, yellow, and dry leaves.
Record the R, G, B values in a table.


Condition	  R	    G	   B
Healthy    120	 200	100
Yellow	   200	 220	120
Dry	       150	 100	80

2. Normalize (Optional)
To reduce the effect of light brightness, normalize RGB by total intensity:
Rnorm = R / (R+G+B)

 Gnorm = G / (R+G+B)

Bnorm = B / (R+G+B)
