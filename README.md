# Green-house-project-
In this project, I will sharing how to make a plant monitoring system using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. The hardware consists of Ardunio Uno as processor, the water pump, the color sensor, and the soil moisture sensor. Data collected from the Arduino board is fed into the Raspberry Pi and transmitted to the cloud where it can be observed and managed.
